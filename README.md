This app allows users to check if there is a ferry going to their destination, how often it runs, when the next one is, and how many minutes away it is.  It also allows whoever schedules them to add new ferries to the table.  I would like to add the ability to edit and remove ferries from the table as well as real time count down to the next ferry.
